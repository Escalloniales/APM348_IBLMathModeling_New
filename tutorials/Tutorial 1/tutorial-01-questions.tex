			In this tutorial you will be introduced to two fundamental tools for Mathematics and MAthematical Modelling:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \LaTeX -- used to write documents. It is a very useful tool that makes creating scientific documents much easier and better looking.
					\item Jupyter Notebooks and Python -- Jupyter notebooks are installed in UofT servers and they include the Python programming language, so it makes programming and annotating with Python much easier
				\end{itemize}
