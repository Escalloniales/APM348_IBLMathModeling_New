\subsection*{Context}
	
In lecture we studied some examples of using the Buckingham Pi Theorem to obtain dimensionless variables to simplify differential equations.

In this tutorial, we will practice going a step further and obtain properties of the solutions of a differential equation not by solving it, but by analyzing the units and their dimensions carefully.


%\subsection*{Resources for TAs}



\subsection*{Before Tutorial}

Send an announcement to students letting them know that they will \textbf{NOT} need to bring a laptop and will be using Jupyter Notebooks \url{https://utoronto.syzygy.ca}.

Students should review the notions of rank, null space, and how to find a null space basis before tutorial.


\subsection*{What to Do}
	
Introduce the learning objectives for the day's tutorial.

Have students get into small groups and start on \#1 -- each group needs to have at least 1 laptop. \\



Problem \ref{q3} is a challenge problem and it is fine if you don't get to it during tutorial.
